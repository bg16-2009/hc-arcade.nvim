# hc-arcade.nvim

A little nvim integration into lualine with the hack hour api

## Dependencies
- neovim 
- Lazy.nvim
- jq
- curl

## Installation
0. Install the dependencies
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the arcade.sh file to ~/.local/bin/
3. Add the plugin spec from lualine.lua to your Lazy.nvim config

NOTE: If you already have a lualine config, you only need to copy the arcade function and add arcade to lualine_x (as seen in the file)
